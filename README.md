Hello, World! 👋

I’m Matei, a student on a journey to discover what I love about computer science. Right now, I’m exploring different areas and learning as much as I can. 
My current setup often involves a Linux terminal and lots of trial and error!

🌱 What I’m Learning

Java ☕: The current focus of my studies.

Python 🐍: A language I’ve dabbled in and enjoy.

🚗 Outside of Tech

I love cars, especially old BMWs.

Boxing whenever i have the time. 🥊
