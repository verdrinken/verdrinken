Hello, World! 👋
I’m Matei, a student on a journey to discover what I love about computer science. Right now, I’m exploring different areas and learning as much as I can. 
My current setup often involves a Linux terminal and lots of trial and error!

🌱 What I’m Learning

Java ☕: The current focus of my studies.
Python 🐍: A language I’ve dabbled in and enjoy.

🚗 Outside of Tech

Cars are my passion. Whether it’s a road trip or geeking out over specs, I’m all in!
Boxing helps me clear my mind and stay sharp. 🥊
